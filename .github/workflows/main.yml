          # Depending on branch protection rules, a  manually populated

          # push to a protected branch must be used. This variable can have an
          # arbitrary name, as an example, this repository uses

          # When using a custom token, it is recommended to leave the following
          # comment for other developers to be aware of the reasoning behind it:
          #
          # This must be used as GitHub Actions token does not support
          # pushing to protected branches.
